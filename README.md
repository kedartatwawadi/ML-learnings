Small snippet notebook tutorials on different things I learnt related to ML

## keras, TF2.0
Recently, at work we decided to move to TF 2.0 and keras from TF1.0. Keras comes up with a lot ofnice feaures to make life easy. However, with a higher level API, comes a higher level of responsibility to use the appropriate level of abstraction. Here are a sequence of tutorials (almost similar to default keras tutorials,but tweaked and arranged in the order I find useful) 

1. Keras hello world
2. Keras different APIs to create models
3. Keras create a custom layer
4. Keras `@tf.function`
5. Keras loss manager
6. Keras training manager
7. Keras internals
8. Compression specific utilities
9. TF AutoGraph


## CUDA/Deploy
1. TensorRT
2. Writing a CUDA Kernel
3. Profiling ML code using NSight

## Python best practices
1. Python `@decorators` [https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)
2. Python `**args, **kwargs` [https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)
3. Python generators (`yield` functionality)
4. Creating a python module/package. Python project structure
5. Creating a python API to a C++ code
6. Python `typing` package
7. Python `@staticmethod` decorator
8. Python `@property` decorator
